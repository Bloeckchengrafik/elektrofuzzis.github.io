Each controller has a USB port which you can use to flash the firmware or your control program. This is described in detail on the next page.

Although the controller can be booted via the USB port, the external 9V supply must be active in order to be able to use the controller's inputs and outputs.

The sensors in the model are connected to inputs A1 to A8 of the controller. Various analog or digital sensors can be connected to these connections (e.g. buttons, reed contacts, phototransistors, temperature sensors). The sensor is simply connected to the <span class="plus">red</span> and <span class="minus">green</span> terminals. With some sensors, the polarity must be observed, then the cable marked on the sensor is connected to the <span class="plus">red</span> terminal. The terminals marked <span class="minus">green</span> are GND or the fischertechnik "-" connection.

Most sensors can be connected to all inputs. Depending on the controller and input, there are individual restrictions - for example, an ultrasonic sensor can only be connected to A1 of the controller types ftSwarm and ftSwarmRS. You can read about this in detail in the description of the individual sensor classes in the API reference.

Normal actuators (e.g. DC motors, lamps, solenoid valves) are connected to the motor outputs M1 to M8. There are separate plugs for servo motors.

Some controllers have an RS485 connection to map Swarm communication via cable as an alternative. The connection diagram is described in a separate [RS485 chapter](../rs485).
